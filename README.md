# Pre-work Study Guide ðŸ“”

## Description

My motivation to doing this project is to do some pre-work and study before I start my Frontend Development journey with the boot camp I recently joined. I built this project so I can look back on the notes whenever I get stuck throughout the boot camp and afterwards. The important topic I learnt was using GitHub and Git - they looked so foreign to me and looked like high-level programming but once I got to using the commands, it become a lot easier!
